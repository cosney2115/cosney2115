## 💻 About Me

Hey! I'm **Matthew**, an 18-year-old dev from Poland 🇵🇱 who's been coding for about **4 years** now.  
I'm a passionate developer who loves building cool stuff and learning new things every day.  
My main jam is **Python 🐍**, but I also mess around with **C# ⚙️**, **TypeScript 🧠**, **Lua 🪄**, and a little **Go 🚀** (though not too much).

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

Here's what I usually work with:

- 🐍 Python (main)
- ⚙️ C#
- 🌐 TypeScript
- 🪄 Lua
- 🚀 Go (sometimes)
- 🦀 Rust (limited experience)

## 🔥 Projects

Currently working on something spicy? Yup! Check it out:

> 🤖 A Discord server & toolset focused on Twitch growth, automation.
> 
> 🎮 **BitkaGG**  
> 🚗 A custom FiveM server I'm currently developing.

## 📈 What I'm into

- Automation & bots 🤖  
- Scripting weird & useful tools 🛠️  
- Learning new languages (both human and programming ones 😅)  
- Tinkering with APIs & backends 🧪
